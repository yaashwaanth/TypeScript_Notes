TypeScript provides static checking.

Typescript helps to write js code in presise manner.

Typescript is all about type safety.

What is static checking ?

Stactic checking is available in various languages like java and golang.
When ever we write the code the parser of the language or the entire syntax of the language is constantly 
being analysed by the IDE's. But not in the case of java script.

Only when the js code is run on the browser or node environment , the errors are thrown on face.

In simple words in TypeScript we don't need to run code for checking errors , it is done while writing the code.


*************** Working ? *****************

we write code in TypeScript and it is converted or transpiled into JS code .

TypeScript is a development tool , our project stills run on Java script (JS) . 



odd behaviour in java script

2 + "2" = '22'   

null + 2 = 2

undefined + 2 = NaN

-> typescript helps to stops this behaviour.
